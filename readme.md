## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
First, download the dataset from my Google Drive ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bfn0wpVacV_7VDJBGiynTIoVYKnmtR-E/view?usp=share_link)) and unpack it into a folder named 'data' in the root directory. This dataset is generated by a SRefSR named C2-matching (https://github.com/lastbasket/C2-Matching).

To test the model on the dataset, run:
```bash
python test --data_root="./data/CUFED5_fusion" --batch_size=1 
```

To fine-tune the model on the dataset, run:
```bash
python train --data_root="./data/CUFED5_fusion" --batch_size=8 --lr=1e-4
```
